## working with FPGAs
I will use this "blog like" github repo to document what I have done with FPGAs.  
And CPLDs (complexity between that of PALs and FPGAs).

* EBAZ4205 board ZYNQ XC7Z010 feature summary ([dual-core ARM Cortex-A9](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds190-Zynq-7000-Overview.pdf#page=2), [Artix-7 FPGA](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds190-Zynq-7000-Overview.pdf#page=3))
* Before trying to login into EBAZ4205 A9 Linux with USB2UART adapter [as described in xjtuecho's github repo](https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205#reset-the-root-password-of-built-in-linux), I tested adapter to login into another Raspberry Pi. That did not work, bought new USB2UART adapter and that failed as well. Finally identified configuration issue responsible ... [more](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=291776)
