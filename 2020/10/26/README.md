I wanted to look into Xilinx (just bought by AMD) and Altera (Intel) FPGAs.  
I did order these cheaps boards for starting handson and learning:

17$ Xilinxss ZYNQ Development Board XC7Z7010  
(with 256MB DDR and 128MB NAND FLASH, and containing dual core A9 CPU which might even run Linux):

20$ Xilinx spartan6 XC6SLX16 (256mbit SDRAM, I know it is eol and spartan7 is current):

29.90$ usb blaster + EP4CE10E22C8N altera fpga cyclone IV board:

From what I have read and have seen on youtube, either VHDL or Verilog is what I might want to do.
