[XILINX CoolRunner-II FPGA CPLD XC2C64A Core development board](https://www.ebay.de/itm/XILINX-CoolRunner-II-FPGA-CPLD-XC2C64A-Core-Module-Mini-Development-For-XBOX360/272864294476) seems to have power led only (and pins A-F). Not sure whether its FPGA delivery demo, but there is a 48MHz frequency on pin C (12.5ns+7.5ns+12.5ns+7.5ns+12.5ns+10ns repeat), which is beyond my 400Msps logic analyzer capabilities to measure correctly.
